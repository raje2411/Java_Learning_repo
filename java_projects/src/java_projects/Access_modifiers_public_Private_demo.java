/*
Javaâ€™s Access Modifiers:

Member access control is achieved through the use of three access modifiers:
public, private, and protected. As explained, if no access modifier is used, the
default access setting is assumed. In this program we will be concerned with
public and private. The protected modifier applies only when inheritance is
involved
